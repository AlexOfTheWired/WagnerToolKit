# Modular Auto Rigger

## This package is currently in development.

I developed this toolkit help maximize the efficiency in the character rigging pipeline. 

It's functionality includes creating rigs by customized module. ie: custom hand modules. The tech artist can edit parameters for each module to create a high level of customization. 

## Import/Export Features
The toolkit can even import and export skin weight values with extreme reliability through data serialization.
If the Tech Artist would like to keep the rigs skeleton as a template for future use, they can do so by using the rig template feature.
